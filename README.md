# Lift Buddy
I like to lift weights with my friends. I have been using a note on my phone to keep track of how much weight and how many reps I am lifting. This is kind of tedious because the note can get long and requires a lot of editing. I also can’t see how my friends are doing on their lifts. My idea is to streamline the process of tracking your weightlifting process, with a simple and intuitive UI. Additionally, there will be a social element that allows you to see other’s lifts, and have conversations with them about their exercises.
